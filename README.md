## Introduction
This repository contains a Python implementation of the Routh-Hurwitz criterion, a method used to determine the stability of a linear system based on the coefficients of its characteristic polynomial.

## What is the Routh-Hurwitz Criterion?
The Routh-Hurwitz criterion is a mathematical test that provides conditions for the stability of a system by analyzing the signs of the determinants of specific matrices derived from the system's characteristic polynomial.

## How to Use
To utilize the Routh-Hurwitz criterion, follow these steps:

1. Import the necessary libraries and functions.
2. Define the characteristic polynomial.
3. Extract the coefficients and create the Routh matrix.
4. Call the `criterion_routh_hurwitz` function to evaluate stability.
